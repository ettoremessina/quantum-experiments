# Random Number Generator #

This example demonstrates the generation of an integer random number (from 0 to 31) on IBM Q Experience platform using Qiskit Notebook.


## Circuit equivalent code ##
The file [RandomNumberGenerator.py](./RandomNumberGenerator.py) is the Python code that implements the following circuit:

## Full working Qiskit Notebook file ##

To execute it import the file [Random Number Generator.ipynb](./Random%20Number%20Generator.ipynb) into your IBM Q Experience account under Qiskit Notebooks panel (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jupyter) and run it.
