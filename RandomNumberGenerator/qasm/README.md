# Random Number Generator

This example demonstrates the generation of an integer random number (from 0 to 31) on IBM Q Experience platform using QASM.


## Circuit equivalent code
The file [RandomNumberGenerator.qasm](./RandomNumberGenerator.qasm) is the QASM code that implements the following circuit:
