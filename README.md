# Quantum Experiments
The goal of this repository is to share experimental code written for different quantum computers and their simulators using different languages and/or libraries for quantum computing.

## Random Number Generator
This program shows how to generate a random integer number using the unpredictability of the measure of a qubit in superposition state because it is a form of natural randomness.
