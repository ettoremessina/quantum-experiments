# Quantum Experiments
The goal of this repository is to share experimental code written for different quantum computers and their simulators using different languages and/or libraries for quantum computing.

## Random Number Generator
This program shows how to generate a random integer number using the unpredictability of the measure of a qubit in superposition state because it is a form of natural randomness.

It contains the same program written in 3 different languages:

###QASM
RandomNumberGenerator/qasm folder contains the qasm script designed to be executed on 'IBM Q Experience' (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).

###Python + IBM Qiskit
RandomNumberGenerator/qiskit folder contains the Python fragement program designed to be executed inside an quantum computing jupyter notebooks always on 'IBM Q Experience' (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).

###Microsoft Q# for .NET Core
RandomNumberGenerator/qsharp folder contains the q# code (plus a c# starter code) for Microsoft .NET Core platform.
