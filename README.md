# Quantum Experiments
The goal of this repository is to share experimental code written for different quantum computers and their simulators using different languages and/or libraries for quantum computing.

## Random Number Generator
[RandomNumberGenerator](./RandomNumberGenerator) folder contains a program written in 3 different languages in order to show how to generate a random integer number using the unpredictability of the measure of a qubit in superposition state because it is a form of natural randomness.

## Cascade Hadamard Gates
[CascadeHadamardGates](./CascadeHadamardGates) folder contains a program written in 3 different languages in order to show the behaviour of a cascade of Hadamard gates.
