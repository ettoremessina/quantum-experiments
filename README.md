# Quantum Experiments
The goal of this repository is to share experimental code written for different quantum computers and their simulators using different languages and/or libraries for quantum computing.

## Quantum Gates
[QuantumGates](./QuantumGates) folder contains experiments on quantum gates, their low level implementation, their underlying math and usage examples in any programming languages.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/quantum-computing/not-cnot-operators.html) for more information.

## Random Number Generator
[RandomNumberGenerator](./RandomNumberGenerator) folder contains a program written in 3 different languages in order to show how to generate a random integer number using the unpredictability of the measure of a qubit in superposition state because it is a form of natural randomness.

Please visit [here](https://computationalmindset.com/en/quantum-computing/random-number-generation.html) for more information.

## Cascade Hadamard Gates
[CascadeHadamardGates](./CascadeHadamardGates) folder contains a program written in 3 different languages in order to show the behaviour of a cascade of Hadamard gates in according with the invertibility of adjoint matrix that models the Hadamard gate.
